I'd be happy to explain the GitHub README alert/callout options available to you! These are Markdown-based callouts that help highlight important information in your repository documentation.

GitHub offers several built-in alert types, each with its own icon and styling. Here's the complete list:

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even if not critical.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for users to get more out of your project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content that requires caution from users.

> [!CAUTION]
> Dangerous actions that could have negative consequences.

> [!ALERT_TYPE]
> Your message here.

These callouts are a great way to make important information stand out in your documentation!
